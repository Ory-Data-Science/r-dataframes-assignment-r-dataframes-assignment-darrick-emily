Question:In a text file, discuss how you know that your fixed version of the code is right and how you would try to make sure it was right if the data file was thousands of lines long
Periodically while typing the code, I ran it to make sure that it was functioning properly. For each part of the assignment, I read the file, and ran it to make sure the data was loaded in correctly. Then i started with the command, making sure to pipe it after each "command" so that i could follow it more easily. Once i figured out that each specific part worked correctly, i moved onto the next. It is much easier to find a missing letter or quotation mark when the lines are split up in this fashion. Also, I tried to print after successfully running each code, and before starting the next portion of the assignment. I knew the code was not correct when an error message appeared. Based on practice, I know that it is much easier to find errors in one specific code rather than multiple seperate ones. Essentially, taking the assignment part by part and not waiting until the end to run the code is the best practice.
